# AI-Chat-Assistant-using-Streamlit-and-LangChain
 Built an AI-Powered Chat Assistant Using LangChain & Streamlit!

Iâ€™ve developed a local-first AI assistant that can handle dynamic user queries, powered by LangChain, Streamlit, and Ollama.

Tech Stack:

LangChain: Used to orchestrate agent behavior with custom tools like Wikipedia for information retrieval.

Streamlit: Provides an interactive and easy-to-use web interface for real-time AI interaction.

ChatOllama: I used Mistral-small3.1 for the language model, enabling efficient processing of natural language queries.

 What It Does:

The app processes user input, makes calls to external tools like Wikipedia for knowledge, and generates context-aware responses.

It's a fully offline solution, which is ideal for privacy-conscious applications or edge computing scenarios.
